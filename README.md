# karaburan

Load ROS 2:
`source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash`

Navigate to ROS workspace:
`cd ros_ws`

# Temperature sensor
Build and run temperature sensor node (my SensorID):
`colcon build && source ./install/setup.bash && ros2 run tempreader tempreaderNode --ros-args -p sensorId:=28.C23646D48524 &`

Launch GPSD client node:
`ros2 launch gpsd_client gpsd_client-launch.py &`

Install ros-jazzy-gpsd-client

Read fixes from GPS:
`ros2 topic echo /fix`

Read temperature:
`ros2 topic echo /temperature`

# Boat total setup launch file

This currently works on My Machine TM (use the generic instructions at the top first):
`colcon build && source install/setup.bash && ros2 launch navigation boat.launch.py`

Replace `boat.launch.py` with `sim.launch.py` for the simulated stuff (laptop only! Requires GUI!)

## Manual control via partial setup

The current setup does not provide `/cmd_vel` commands other than 'stop'.
So you can try to do that yourself:

```
# Forward
ros2 topic pub -r 10 /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/msg/Twist "{linear: {x: 0.2}, angular: {z: 0.0}}"
# Turn left
ros2 topic pub -r 10 /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/msg/Twist "{linear: {x: 0.0}, angular: {z: 0.5}}"
# Stop
ros2 topic pub -1 /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/msg/Twist "{linear: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}, angular: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}}"

# Useful checks:
ros2 topic info /cmd_vel
ros2 interface show geometry_msgs/msg/Twist
ros2 topic echo /cmd_vel
ros2 topic list | grep cmd_vel

# Keyboard-control:
ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard --ros-args -r cmd_vel:=/cmd_vel
```

## MCAP recording

Install the MCAP storage plugin alongside ROS 2 Jazzy on the boat:

```bash
sudo apt install ros-jazzy-rosbag2 ros-jazzy-rosbag2-storage-mcap
sudo mkdir -p /data/karaburan/bags
sudo chown "$USER":"$USER" /data/karaburan/bags
```

Recording is disabled by default. Start the physical boat with the standard
`navigation` profile without LiDAR:

```bash
ros2 launch navigation boat.launch.py \
  record_enabled:=true \
  record_profile:=navigation \
  record_include_scan:=false \
  record_output_dir:=/data/karaburan/bags
```

For the simulator:

```bash
ros2 launch navigation sim.launch.py \
  record_enabled:=true \
  record_profile:=navigation \
  record_include_scan:=false \
  record_output_dir:=./bags
```

Available profiles:

| Profile | Topics |
|---|---|
| `minimal` | GPS, temperature, sonar, VL53L0X time-of-flight (ToF), and BT785 |
| `navigation` | `minimal` plus IMU, odometry, commands, TF, and TF-static |
| `full` | `navigation` plus `/scan` |

`record_include_scan:=true` also adds `/scan` to `minimal` or `navigation`.
Use `record_extra_topics` to add comma-separated topics:

```bash
ros2 launch navigation boat.launch.py \
  record_enabled:=true \
  record_profile:=navigation \
  record_extra_topics:="/diagnostics,/battery_state"
```

Additional recording arguments:

| Argument | Default | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| `record_enabled` | `false` | Enable or disable MCAP recording |
| `record_profile` | `navigation` | `minimal`, `navigation`, or `full` |
| `record_include_scan` | `false` | Explicitly include LiDAR |
| `record_output_dir` | boat: `/data/karaburan/bags`; sim: `./bags` | Recording root directory |
| `record_max_bag_duration` | `900` | Start a new segment after 15 minutes; `0` disables duration-based rotation |
| `record_max_bag_size` | `2147483648` | Start a new segment after 2 GiB; `0` disables size-based rotation |
| `record_start_delay` | `5.0` | Delay recording to allow topic discovery |

The recorder uses MCAP with the `zstd_fast` profile. Each launch creates a
UTC-dated directory. Inspect a recording with:

```bash
ros2 bag info /data/karaburan/bags/<recording-directory>
```

### Storage estimate

The estimate uses the agreed frequencies for the physical boat:

| Data stream | Frequency |
|---|---:|
| GPS | 1 Hz |
| IMU | 30 Hz |
| Sonar | 1 Hz |
| Temperature | 0.2 Hz |
| Physical LiDAR | approximately 5.8 Hz |
| VL53L0X ToF sensor | 20 Hz |
| BT785 | 0.1 Hz |
| Filtered odometry | 40 Hz |

Assumptions: one sailing day contains eight recording hours and local retention
covers two sailing days, or 16 recording hours. The calculation uses estimated
serialized ROS message sizes plus a 25% allowance for MCAP indexes, metadata,
variation, and filesystem overhead. It conservatively assumes no reduction from
Zstd compression.

| Recording | Planning rate per hour | 8 hours | 2 sailing days / 16 hours |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `navigation`, excluding `/scan` | approximately 0.23 GB | approximately 1.8 GB | approximately 3.6 GB; reserve 4 GB |
| Physical `/scan` only, additional | approximately 0.13 GB | approximately 1.0 GB | approximately 2.0 GB |
| `navigation` including `/scan` | approximately 0.36 GB | approximately 2.8 GB | approximately 5.6 GB; reserve 6 GB |

The physical `LaserScan` contains 576 ranges and 576 intensities per scan.
Consequently, `/scan` adds approximately 2 GB over two sailing days, despite its
5.8 Hz rate. Actual compression depends heavily on the environment and intensity
values. Measure the first real voyage with `du -sh` and adjust this estimate.

### Foxglove visualization demo

The [Foxglove demo](foxglove/README.md) includes a synthetic MCAP recording and
a reusable user script that colors the travelled GPS route by measured water
temperature.

If two days later means **48 hours of continuous recording**, reserve
approximately 12 GB without `/scan` or 18 GB with `/scan`. In practice, keep at
least 16 GB free without LiDAR and 32 GB when recording LiDAR. This allows space
for segments awaiting upload and prevents the system disk from filling up.

### Optional measurement instruments

The physical measurement drivers are disabled by default. Enable only the
instruments connected to the boat:

```bash
ros2 launch navigation boat.launch.py \
  with_temperature:=true \
  temperature_sensor_id:=28.C23646D48524 \
  with_sonar:=true \
  sonar_device:=D3:01:01:02:2F:C6 \
  with_lidar:=true \
  lidar_device:=/dev/ttyUSB0 \
  with_tof:=true \
  tof_rate_hz:=20.0 \
  with_bt785:=true \
  bt785_device:=AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
```

The same arguments are available on `sim.launch.py`, but enabling them starts
the physical hardware drivers. This is intended for hardware-in-the-loop tests.
They remain disabled by default because the simulator already publishes
`/scan`, `/imu/data`, and `/fix/valid`.

### Testing with Rancher Desktop and Docker

The launch files and MCAP recording can be tested on this laptop without a
local ROS installation. Start Rancher Desktop, select a Docker-compatible
container engine, and run:

```bash
docker context use default
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.ros-jazzy-test -t karaburan-ros-test .
docker run --rm karaburan-ros-test
```

The container builds the ROS workspace and performs a smoke test that:

1. starts the storage launch file with a short rotation interval;
2. publishes sample `sensor_msgs/NavSatFix` messages on `/fix`;
3. verifies that multiple MCAP segments are created;
4. inspects the recording with `ros2 bag info`;
5. verifies that the `/fix` topic and message count are present;
6. checks that disabled storage creates no files; and
7. imports all launch files to catch Python syntax and dependency errors.

This test does not emulate I2C, serial, Bluetooth, or 1-Wire hardware. Testing
the physical sensor drivers still requires the boat or explicit device
passthrough into the container.
